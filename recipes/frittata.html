        <li>16 fresh mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>

        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine zucchini, bell pepper, garlic, and salt in a large, oven-safe skillet. Add 1 cup water and simmer until zucchini is tender, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain vegetables in a colander; discard garlic.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, mushrooms, and butter; add drained vegetables. Cook and stir until onion is transparent, about 5 minutes.
             Stir in beaten eggs and season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to low and cook until eggs are set, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and sprinkle mozzarella cheese over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and turn on the broiler.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over frittata. Place under the preheated broiler until cheese is bubbling and golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes before cutting into 5 wedges and serving.</li>
    </ol>
